# tic-tac-toe

This is an implementation of the tic-tac-toe game in Haskell, with a simple CLI interface.

To use, make sure you have stack installed, and type `stack run` after cloning the repo. Then you enter a default two-player mode in which you can choose the action by entering two space-separated integers denoting grid positions (1-3)
